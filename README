Job Board
=========

This is a simple Job Board for Django.  It allows both for people to
publish about available jobs and for those seeking jobs (called
"applicants" in the application) to publish their resumes.


Installation
============

We don't have an official release at this time, but you can install by using
the following steps:

    git clone https://github.com/ImaginaryLandscape/iscape-jobboard.git
    cd iscape-jobboard
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install


Captcha (Optional)
=============

We've added basic support for CAPTCHA on the job and resume posting forms. 
We're currently leveraging ``django-simple-captcha`` for our CAPTCHA needs. In
order to use it you'll need to install the following applications:

    django-simple-captcha
    PIL (Python Imaging library)

Then just place 'captcha' in your installed applications, and sync the 
database. django-simple-captcha is very customizable, so we recommend viewing
http://code.google.com/p/django-simple-captcha/wiki/CaptchaConfiguration for
all your configuration options.

Configuration
=============

Put the following in your settings module:

    JOBBOARD_JOBS_ON_INDEX = 5
    JOBBOARD_JOBS_PER_PAGE = 15
    JOBBOARD_APPLICANTS_ON_INDEX = 5
    JOBBOARD_APPLICANTS_PER_PAGE = 15
    JOBBOARD_POSTS_EXPIRE_DAYS = 30
    JOBBOARD_FROM_EMAIL = SERVER_EMAIL


A brief description of each of these settings:

================================  =========================================
Setting                           Description
================================  =========================================
``JOBBOARD_JOBS_ON_INDEX``        How many job postings should appear on
                                  the index page

``JOBBOARD_JOBS_PER_PAGE``        How many job postings should appear per
                                  page on the active jobs listing

``JOBBOARD_APPLICANTS_ON_INDEX``  How many applicant postings should appear
                                  on the index page

``JOBBOARD_APPLICANTS_PER_PAGE``  How many applicant postings should appear
                                  per page on the active jobs listing

``JOBBOARD_POSTS_EXPIRE_DAYS``    In how many days from submission a post
                                  will "expire" and no longer appear on the
                                  listing or index

``JOBBOARD_FROM_EMAIL``           What address notification emails will
                                  appear to come from
================================  =========================================

You'll also have to add to your INSTALLED_APPS setting the following::

  'jobboard', 
  'django.contrib.humanize',

In your root ``urls.py``, add the following to your urlpatterns::

    (r'^jobboard/', include('jobboard.urls')),

Sync your database with ``syncdb`` from the command line.

Customizing templates
=====================

All of job board's templates are customizable and overridable, and all
exist under the the template path of 'jobboard/'.  There are a few
templates you will likely want to override to meet the needs of your
particular site.  (Note that these are *not* the only templates, only
the ones that most users will want to override.)


jobboard/base.html
------------------

All templates in this application inherit from this file.  By default,
this file also inherits from the file ``base_site.html``.  Note that
an example file of base_site.html is provided by this application, but
you should either override that in a site level templates directory or
change base.html to wrap whatever base site template you use.


jobboard/index.html
-------------------

This is the first page visitors to this application should see.  You
should probably override this template and fill in whatever
introduction message you would like your visitors to see (currently it
provides a block of lorem ipsum text where your message should go).


Usage
=====

The first thing you will definitely want to do is to add entries to the
Position table.  Each entry here will be an option describing a type
of position users can both apply to and employers can offer jobs for.
For example, if you added three entries of "Python Programmer",
"System Administrator" and "Other", users will have the option to make
posts relevant to any of those three positions.

The second thing you may want to do after installing this application
are to go to the Django admin and add one or more entries to the
NotifyEmail table.  While this isn't necessary, it is recommended, as
any email address in this list will get sent a message any time a new
post is submitted to the site.

Other than that, interfacing with the job board is fairly simple.  New
job posts are submitted and assigned an expiration date relevant to
jobboard's "JOBBOARD_POSTS_EXPIRE_DAYS" configuration option.  If
you're in the NotifyEmail table, you'll be sent an email notifying you
of any and all new submissions, and then you'll have the option to go
in and approve or delete any such posting.  Any posts that are
approved will appear on the index of the job board and in either the
job or applicant listings.
